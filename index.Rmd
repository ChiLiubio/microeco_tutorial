# Background

ã€€R language [@R-base] and its packages ecosystem are wonderful tools for data analysis.
In microbial community ecology field, many packages can be used for the data analysis, 
such as vegan[@Jari_vegan_2019], ape[@Paradis_ape_2018] and picante[@Picante_Kembel_2010].
However, with the development of the high-throughput sequencing techniques,
the increasing data amount and complexity make the data mining a challenge.
There have been some R packages created for the statistics and visualization in microbial community ecology, such as phyloseq[@Mcmurdie_phyloseq_2013],
microbiome (https://github.com/microbiome/microbiome), microbiomeSeq (http://www.github.com/umerijaz/microbiomeSeq), 
ampvis2 (https://madsalbertsen.github.io/ampvis2/reference/index.html), MicrobiomeR(https://github.com/vallenderlab/MicrobiomeR),
theseus[@Price_theseus_2018], rANOMALY[@Theil_rANOMALY_2021], 
MicrobiomeExplorer[@Reeder_MicrobiomeExplorer_2021],
tidyMicro[@Carpenter_tidyMicro_2021] 
and so on.
However, we lack a flexible, comprehensive and modularized R package to analyze and manage the data.
So we create the microeco R package[@Liu_microeco_2021] for this goal (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco).
Besides, we also develop the file2meco package (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/file2meco) for the data input from other tools easily
and mecodev package (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/mecodev) for some extending approaches in the area.
