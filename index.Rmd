# Background

ã€€R language [@R-base] and its packages ecosystem are wonderful tools for data analysis.
In the field of microbial community ecology, many packages can be used for the data analysis, 
such as vegan [@Jari_vegan_2019], ape [@Paradis_ape_2018] and picante [@Picante_Kembel_2010].
However, with the development of the high-throughput sequencing techniques,
the increasing data amount and complexity make the data mining a challenge.
There have been some R packages created for the statistics and visualization in microbial community ecology, 
such as phyloseq [@Mcmurdie_phyloseq_2013],
microbiome (https://github.com/microbiome/microbiome), microbiomeSeq (http://www.github.com/umerijaz/microbiomeSeq), 
ampvis2 (https://madsalbertsen.github.io/ampvis2/reference/index.html), MicrobiomeR(https://github.com/vallenderlab/MicrobiomeR),
theseus [@Price_theseus_2018], rANOMALY [@Theil_rANOMALY_2021], 
MicrobiomeExplorer [@Reeder_MicrobiomeExplorer_2021],
tidyMicro [@Carpenter_tidyMicro_2021], microbial (https://github.com/guokai8/microbial), 
and so on.
In addition, some web tools associated with R language are also useful for microbial community data analysis, 
such as Shiny-phyloseq [@McMurdie_Shiny_2015], Mian [@Jin_Mian_2021] and animalcules [@Zhao_animalcules_2021].
However, users still lack a flexible, comprehensive and modularized R package to analyze and manage the data easily.
So we created the microeco R package [@Liu_microeco_2021] for this goal (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco).
Besides, we also develop the file2meco package (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/file2meco) for the data input from some famous tools easily
and mecodev package (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/mecodev) for some extending approaches in this field.
