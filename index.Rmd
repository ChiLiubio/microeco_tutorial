# Prerequisites

ã€€R language and its packages ecosystem are wonderful tools for data analysis.
In microbial community ecology field, many packages can be used for the data analysis, 
such as vegan[@Jari_vegan_2019], ape[@Paradis_ape_2018] and picante[@Picante_Kembel_2010].
However, with the development of the high-throughput sequencing techniques,
the increasing data amount and complexity make the data analysis a challenge.
There have been some R packages created for the community data analysis in microbial ecology, such as phyloseq[@Mcmurdie_phyloseq_2013],
microbiome (https://github.com/microbiome/microbiome), microbiomeSeq (http://www.github.com/umerijaz/microbiomeSeq), 
ampvis2 (https://madsalbertsen.github.io/ampvis2/reference/index.html), MicrobiomeR(https://github.com/vallenderlab/MicrobiomeR) 
and rANOMALY[@Theil_rANOMALY_2021].
However, we lack a flexible, comprehensive and modularized R package to analyze and manage the data.
We create the microeco R package[@Liu_microeco_2021] for this goal (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco).
