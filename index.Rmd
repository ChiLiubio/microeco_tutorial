# Background

ã€€R language [@R-base] and its packages ecosystem are wonderful tools for data analysis.
In the field of microbial community ecology, many packages can be used for the statistical analysis, 
such as vegan [@Jari_vegan_2019], ape [@Paradis_ape_2018] and picante [@Picante_Kembel_2010].
However, with the development of the high-throughput sequencing techniques,
the increasing data amount and complexity of studies make the data mining a challenge.
There have been some R packages created for the statistics and visualization for microbiome data, 
such as phyloseq [@Mcmurdie_phyloseq_2013],
microbiome (https://github.com/microbiome/microbiome), microbiomeSeq (http://www.github.com/umerijaz/microbiomeSeq), 
ampvis2 (https://github.com/KasperSkytte/ampvis2), MicrobiomeR(https://github.com/vallenderlab/MicrobiomeR),
theseus [@Price_theseus_2018], rANOMALY [@Theil_rANOMALY_2021], 
tidyMicro [@Carpenter_tidyMicro_2021], microbial (https://github.com/guokai8/microbial), 
amplicon (https://github.com/microbiota/amplicon) 
and so on.
In addition, some web tools associated with R language are also useful for microbial community data analysis, 
such as Shiny-phyloseq [@McMurdie_Shiny_2015], MicrobiomeExplorer [@Reeder_MicrobiomeExplorer_2021], 
animalcules [@Zhao_animalcules_2021] and Namco [@Dietrich_Namco_2022].
Even so, users still lack a flexible, comprehensive and modularized R package to analyze and manage the data fast and easily.
So we created the microeco R package [@Liu_microeco_2021] for this goal (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco).
Besides, we also developed the file2meco package (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/file2meco) for the data input from some famous tools easily
and mecodev package (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/mecodev) for some extending approaches in this field.
