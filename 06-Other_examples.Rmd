## Custom taxa order in bar plot

Jarrod J. Scott contribute a cool answer to the question that how to use custom taxa and the order in bar plot.
This is a discussion topic in microeco Discussions part. Here is the link (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco/discussions/45).

## Question of prefix in the taxa

The prefix of taxa in taxonomic table may affect the following performance of plotting, e.g. text in legend.
Please see those Issues (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco/issues/32), (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco/issues/7) 
and (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco/issues/15).

## The use of phylogenetic tree

One of Issues referred to the basic use of phylogenetic tree (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco/issues/33).

## The importance of tidy_taxonomy function

The taxonomic classification with standard prefix is very important for many analysis,
e.g. taxonomic abundance plotting and biomarker finding.
The tidy_taxonomy function is designed to make the taxa having standard prefix.
See those Issues for the detailed examples: (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco/issues/32) and (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco/issues/22).
