The return table is stored in each network object. soil_amp_network %&lt;&gt;% get_node_table(node_roles = TRUE) %&gt;% get_edge_table 11.4 Compare nodes across networks The nodes in all the networks can be converted to a new microtable object by using the node_comp function of meconetcomp package.

Here, we indicated the phylogenetic distance distributions and performed the differential test among networks. The input parameter dis_matrix can be any symmetric matrix with both the column names and row names (i.e. feature names). So it is also feasible to compare other properties of features, such as Levin’s niche overlap. # filter useless features to speed up the calculation node_names &lt;- unique(unlist(lapply(soil_amp_network, function(x){colnames(x$data_abund)}))) filter_soil_amp &lt;- microeco::clone(soil_amp) filter_soil_amp$otu_table &lt;- filter_soil_amp$otu_table[node_names, ] filter_soil_amp$tidy_dataset() # obtain phylogenetic distance matrix phylogenetic_distance_soil &lt;- as.matrix(cophenetic(filter_soil_amp$phylo_tree)) # use both the positive and negative labels tmp &lt;- edge_node_distance$new(network_list = soil_amp_network, dis_matrix = phylogenetic_distance_soil, label = c(&quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;)) tmp$cal_diff(method = &quot;anova&quot;) # visualization g1 &lt;- tmp$plot(add = &quot;none&quot;, add_sig = TRUE, add_sig_text_size = 5) + ylab(&quot;Phylogenetic distance&quot;) ggsave(&quot;soil_amp_phylo_distance.pdf&quot;, g1, width = 7, height = 6) # show different modules with at least 10 nodes and positive edges tmp &lt;- edge_node_distance$new(network_list = soil_amp_network, dis_matrix = phylogenetic_distance_soil, label = &quot;+&quot;, with_module = TRUE, module_thres = 10) tmp$cal_diff(method = &quot;anova&quot;) g1 &lt;- tmp$plot(add = &quot;none&quot;, add_sig = TRUE, add_sig_text_size = 5) + ylab(&quot;Phylogenetic distance&quot;) ggsave(&quot;soil_amp_phylo_distance_modules.pdf&quot;, g1, width = 8, height = 6) 11.8 Compare node sources of edges across networks To know which taxa constitute the nodes in edges is important in understanding species co-occurrence patterns and answering ecological questions. In this part, as an instance, we used edge_tax_comp function of meconetcomp package to get the sums of node sources (at Phylum level) in the positive edges. In other words, how many linked nodes of positive edges come from different phyla or the same phyla. Then, to make the results comparable, the ratio was calculated with the positive edge number as denominator. soil_amp_network_edgetax &lt;- edge_tax_comp(soil_amp_network, taxrank = &quot;Phylum&quot;, label = &quot;+&quot;, rel = TRUE) # filter the features with small number soil_amp_network_edgetax &lt;- soil_amp_network_edgetax[apply(soil_amp_network_edgetax, 1, mean) &gt; 0.01, ] # visualization g1 &lt;- pheatmap::pheatmap(soil_amp_network_edgetax, display_numbers = TRUE) ggsave(&quot;soil_amp_edge_tax_comp.pdf&quot;, g1, width = 7, height = 7) 11.9 Compare topological properties of sub-networks In this part, we extracted the sub-networks according to the OTU existed in each sample of soil_amp dataset for each network in soil_amp_network. Then, the global topological properties of sub-networks were calculated. All the operations were encapsulated into the subnet_property function of meconetcomp package. # calculate global properties of all sub-networks tmp &lt;- subnet_property(soil_amp_network) # then prepare the data for the correlation analysis # use sample names (second column) as rownames rownames(tmp) &lt;- tmp[, 2] # delete first two columns (network name and sample name) tmp &lt;- tmp[, -c(1:2)] # load ready-made abiotic factor and diversity table data(soil_measure_diversity) tmp1 &lt;- trans_env$new(dataset = soil_amp, add_data = soil_measure_diversity) tmp1$cal_cor(use_data = &quot;other&quot;, by_group = &quot;Group&quot;, add_abund_table = tmp, cor_method = &quot;spearman&quot;) # generate correlation heatmap g1 &lt;- tmp1$plot_cor() ggsave(&quot;soil_amp_subnet_property.pdf&quot;, g1, width = 11, height = 5) 11.10 Robustness of network The robustness analysis is implemented in the robustness class based on several edge and node removal strategies and robustness measures (Bellingeri et al. 2020; J. Liu et al. 2017). For the details of each method, please refer to the help document with the command ?robustness. Available options of remove_strategy parameter include “edge_rand” (edges are randomly removed), “edge_strong” (edges are removed in decreasing order of weight), “node_rand” (nodes are removed randomly), “node_hub” (node hubs are randomly removed, including network hubs and module hubs), “node_degree_high” (nodes are removed in decreasing order of degree), etc. Available options of measure include “Eff”, “Eigen” and “Pcr”. “Eff” denotes the network efficiency (J. Liu et al. 2017). The average efficiency of the network is defined: \\[ Eff = \\frac{1}{N(N - 1)} \\sum_{i \\neq j \\in G}\\frac{1}{d(i, j)} \\] where N is the total number of nodes and \\(d(i,j)\\) is the shortest path between node \\(i\\) and node \\(j\\). When the weight is found in the edge attributes, \\(d(i,j)\\) denotes the weighted shortest path between node \\(i\\) and node \\(j\\). “Eigen” represents the natural connectivity. The natural connectivity can be regarded as an average eigenvalue that changes strictly monotonically with the addition or deletion of edges. It is defined: \\[ \\bar{\\lambda} = \\ln(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} e^{\\lambda~i~}) \\] where \\(\\lambda~i~\\) is the \\(i\\)th eigenvalue of the graph adjacency matrix. The larger the value of \\(\\bar{\\lambda}\\) is, the more robust the network is. “Pcr” means the critical removal fraction of vertices (edges) for the disintegration of networks. This is a robustness measure based on random graph theory. The critical fraction against random attacks is labeled as \\(P_{c}^r\\). It is defined: \\[ P_{c}^r = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\langle k^2 \\rangle}{\\langle k \\rangle} - 1} \\] where \\(\\langle k \\rangle\\) is the average nodal degree of the original network, and \\(\\langle k^2 \\rangle\\) is the average of square of nodal degree. tmp &lt;- robustness$new(soil_amp_network, remove_strategy = c(&quot;edge_rand&quot;, &quot;edge_strong&quot;, &quot;node_rand&quot;, &quot;node_degree_high&quot;), remove_ratio = seq(0, 0.99, 0.1), measure = c(&quot;Eff&quot;, &quot;Eigen&quot;, &quot;Pcr&quot;), run = 10) View(tmp$res_table) View(tmp$res_summary) tmp$plot(linewidth = 1) We can also extract the result for a specified metric and perform the visualization, such as the scatter plot. tmp1 &lt;- tmp$res_table %&gt;% .[.$remove_strategy == &quot;node_rand&quot; &amp; .$measure == &quot;Eigen&quot;, ] t1 &lt;- trans_env$new(dataset = NULL, add_data = tmp1) t1$dataset$sample_table &lt;- t1$data_env t1$plot_scatterfit(x = &quot;remove_ratio&quot;, y = &quot;value&quot;, type = &quot;cor&quot;, group = &quot;Network&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Ratio of randomly removed nodes&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Network connectivity&quot;) + theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 15)) # another way; for microeco version &gt;= 1.8.0 t1$plot_scatterfit(x = tmp1$remove_ratio, y = tmp1$value, type = &quot;cor&quot;, group = tmp1$Network) 11.11 Vulnerability of nodes From v0.4.0, the vulnerability of nodes can be calculated with the vulnerability function. The vulnerability of one node is defined as the efficiency of network after removing this targeted node (Yuan et al. 2021). For the details, please swith to the help document. vul_table &lt;- vulnerability(soil_amp_network) View(vul_table) 11.12 Cohesion The cohesion is a method for quantifying the connectivity of microbial communities (Herren and McMahon 2017). From v0.5.0, the cohesion is implemented in cohesionclass. It is defined: \\[ C_{j}^{pos} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \\cdot \\bar{r_{i}}_{|r&gt;0} \\] \\[ C_{j}^{neg} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \\cdot \\bar{r_{i}}_{|r&lt;0} \\] where \\(C_{j}^{pos}\\) is the positive cohesion, and \\(C_{j}^{neg}\\) is the negative cohesion. \\(a_{i}\\) is the relative abundance of species \\(i\\) in sample \\(j\\). \\(\\bar{r_{i}}_{|r&gt;0}\\) denotes the mean weight (correlation coefficient, interaction strength) of all the edges (related with species \\(i\\)) with positive association. t1 &lt;- cohesionclass$new(soil_amp_network) View(t1$res_list$sample) View(t1$res_list$feature) t1$cal_diff(measure = &quot;r_pos&quot;, method = &quot;anova&quot;) t1$plot() # without statistical result t1 &lt;- cohesionclass$new(soil_amp_network) t1$plot(measure = &quot;c_neg&quot;) References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
