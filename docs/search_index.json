In microbial community ecology field, many packages can be used for the data analysis, such as vegan(Oksanen et al. 2019), ape(Paradis and Schliep 2018) and picante(Kembel et al. 2010). However, with the development of the high-throughput sequencing techniques, the increasing data amount and complexity make the data analysis a challenge. There have been some R packages created for the community data analysis in microbial ecology, such as phyloseq(Mcmurdie and Holmes 2013), microbiome (https://github.com/microbiome/microbiome), microbiomeSeq (http://www.github.com/umerijaz/microbiomeSeq), ampvis2 (https://madsalbertsen.github.io/ampvis2/reference/index.html), MicrobiomeR(https://github.com/vallenderlab/MicrobiomeR) and rANOMALY(Theil and Rifa 2021). However, we lack a flexible, comprehensive and modularized R package to analyze and manage the data. We create the microeco R package(Liu et al. 2021) for this goal (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco).

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
