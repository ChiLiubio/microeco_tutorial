# Prerequisites

ã€€R language and its packages ecosystem are wonderful tools for data analysis.
In microbial community ecology field, many packages can be used for the data analysis, 
such as vegan[@Jari_vegan_2019], ape[@Paradis_ape_2018] and picante[@Picante_Kembel_2010].
However, with the development of the high-throughput sequencing techniques,
the increasing data amount and complexity make the data analysis a challenge.
There have been some R packages created for the community data analysis in microbial ecology, such as phyloseq[@Mcmurdie_phyloseq_2013],
microbiome (https://github.com/microbiome/microbiome), microbiomeSeq (http://www.github.com/umerijaz/microbiomeSeq), 
ampvis2 (https://madsalbertsen.github.io/ampvis2/reference/index.html), MicrobiomeR(https://github.com/vallenderlab/MicrobiomeR) 
and rANOMALY[@Theil_rANOMALY_2021].
However, we lack a flexible, comprehensive and modularized R package to analyze and manage the data.
We create the microeco R package[@Liu_microeco_2021] for this goal (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco).

# Introduction {#intro}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

# Literature

Here is a review of existing methods.

# Methods

We describe our methods in this chapter.

Math can be added in body using usual syntax like this 

## math example

$p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

$$
SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
$$

You can also use math in footnotes like this^[where we mention $p = \frac{a}{b}$].

We will approximate standard error to 0.027[^longnote]

[^longnote]: $p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

    $$
    SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
    $$
